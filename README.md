## **Profile**

Having worked successfully in health communications and scientific research for 5+ years, I decided to pursue my passion for coding and retrain as a software developer. I enjoy building and creating applications that are innovative, functional, and accessible to all.

At present, I am in pursuit of a Frontend Web Developer role where I can contribute to the creation of web applications that help people and align with my interests. I am looking to work for a company that has good core principles, values its staff, as well as an engaging and enriching environment to further support my journey.

## **Skills**

### **Adaptable and Meticulous**

Upon graduating from university, I was able to take the analytical skills gained and apply them during my time as an auditor. My ability to adapt quickly to this role led to the most successful audit (100%) within my team. My contribution to this success was acknowledged by the operations director, who attributed the accomplishment to strengthening and solidifying the companyâ€™s relationship with the client.

In addition, all of my roles thus far have required extreme attention to detail. This was imperative when conducting laboratory assays and calculating the results. My meticulous work ethic led to my line manager entrusting me to design a new laboratory method that would be used to analyse samples.

### **Effective Communicator and Problem Solver**

As a Research Technician, I engaged in monthly project meetings with external collaborators across the UK to discuss project trajectory and improvement strategies, specifically in relation to the data reports I generated and recruitment.

During the bootcamp, I created a personal pair-programming feedback form that allowed members of my cohort to comment on my pair-programming style. These forms acknowledged my ability to research diligently, as well as identify and implement solutions effectively.
